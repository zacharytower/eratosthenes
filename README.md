# eratosthenes
Library that standardizes primality testing. Includes a sieve of Eratosthenes function/generator.

This python module includes some basic functionality when working with prime numbers. Such tools are strangely absent when
working with the Python standard library. Some of the functions include:
  - A sieve of Eratosthenes (prime sieve) generator function,
  - A Euler totient function,
  - A basic prime number test,
  - etc.
